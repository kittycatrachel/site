              Pugs are the best, they love without condition. Their silliness is enduring, and you can always be sure a Pug will always want to make you smile. Sure, they're not the best looking pups out there, but to me they are perfect in every which way. From the way they turn their heard when you talk to them to the way they carry themselves around others. Pugs are the greatest dogs you can own!
